I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Auckland, where I also graduated with B.Sc. (Hons) and M.Sc. (First Class), all majoring in statistics.
  My main research interests are <b>survival analysis</b>, <b>longitudinal data</b> and <b>sampling</b>. 
</p> 


<p style="text-align:justify">
My doctoral research is about joint modelling of longitudinal medical cost and survival in complex samples. The aim of the research is to combine survey calibration with
  standard joint models, by using calibrated sampling weights in the joint likelihood. Specifically, I am interested in
  <ul>
  <li>Joint models which combine longitudinal and survival (time-to-event) data into a single model</li>
  <li>Solving intractable integrals arising from random effects in (generalised) linear mixed models</li>
  <li>Using auxiliary variables to reduce variance in parameter estimation</li>
</ul>
